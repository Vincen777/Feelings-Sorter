2827  tripped when he stepped backward 
2828  he faced forward 
2829  he hit me and I hit him back 
2830  I was kept in after school for talking back to the teacher

2845  he listened passively 
2846  he behaves crazily when he is off his medication 
2847  he stops by daily 
2848  he walked around dizzily 
2849  he was doubly wrong 
2850  he was particularly fussy about spelling 
2851  he went elsewhere 
2852  I meant it facetiously 
2853  he works quickly 
2854  how fast can he get here? 
2855  ran as fast as he could 
2856  he ran flat out to catch the bus 
2857  he was off down the road like blue murder 
2858  he flatly denied the charges

2874  he is outright dishonest 
2875  I hope you will come home for Christmas 
2876  he worked at home

2879  so far as it is reasonably practical he should practice restraint 
2880  he works more now 
2881  he works less these days 
2882  he talked little about his family 
2883  I belatedly wished her a happy birthday 
2884  he awoke betimes that morning 
2885  for that matter I don't care either 
2886  he traveled far 
2887  a far far better thing that I do 
2888  I can only go so far before I have to give up 
2889  he traveled far and wide 
2890  at first he didn't notice anything strange

2909  then he left 
2910  I was young then 
2911  if he didn't take it, then who did? 
2912  he observed the snakes so he could describe their behavior 
2913  he stooped down so he could pick up his hat 
2914  he carried on regardless of the difficulties 
2915  once I ran into her 
2916  at one time he loved her 
2917  he was elected on his predecessor's coattails

2940  he was surprisingly friendly 
2941  Have I eaten enough? 
2942  he was insufficiently prepared 
2943  he finally accepted hesitantly 
2944  thereafter he never called again 
2945  I love you so 
2946  he was so tired he could hardly stand 
2947  They're happy and I hope they will remain so 
2948  I can only go so far with this student 
2949  I was offended and so was he 
2950  he is such a baby 
2951  he won easily

3058  he can perceive shapes kinesthetically 
3059  he perceives shapes tactually 
3060  he rejected her words rebelliously 
3061  fearlessly, he led the troops into combat

3073  he guessed right 
3074  he decided to reveal the details only after other sources had reported them incorrectly 
3075  he works very accurately 
3076  he fell right into the trap 
3077  he was rightly considered the greatest singer of his time 
3078  he was unjustly singled out for punishment 
3079  he wandered around aimlessly 
3080  he stared darkly at her 
3081  he was led astray 
3082  hastily, he scanned the headlines 
3083  he cracked his knuckles restlessly 
3084  he was psychically blind 
3085  I can't meet with you today

3113  he worked relentlessly 
3114  `I made a big mistake,' he said ruefully 
3115  he treated her impolitely 
3116  `I'll do the dishes,' he said pleasantly 
3117  he had been unpleasantly surprised 
3118  `Come and visit me,' he said amiably 
3119  he told the story laughingly 
3120  he was ceremonially sworn in as President 
3121  he was dismissed unceremoniously 
3122  he interprets the law narrowly 
3123  he interprets the law broadly 
3124  he smiled broadly 
3125  he followed behind

3127  he took off with a squeal of tires and left the other cars far behind

3139  he suffered mentally 
3140  he smiled shyly 
3141  he blew his nose noisily 
3142  he reviewed the play favorably 
3143  he reviewed the play unfavorably 
3144  he cheerfully agreed to do it 
3145  he cheerlessly set out to do the task 
3146  he bounced it cleanly off the wall 
3147  I know that,  he said dryly
3148  obligingly, he lowered his voice

3197  he visited his cousins fortnightly 
3198  he called home semiweekly 
3199  he was halfway down the ladder when he fell 
3200  I hereby declare you man and wife 
3201  the committee recommended, inter alia, that he be promoted 
3202  he is the honest politician par excellence 
3203  he uttered a curse sotto voce 
3204  I called you thrice last night 
3205  he repeated her remarks verbatim 
3206  I heard it viva voce 
3207  came earlier than I expected 
3208  could he walk out in the midst of his piece? 
3209  I don't know the figures off-hand 
3210  he kissed her cheek perfunctorily 
3211  I can live here rent-free 
3212  I buy food wholesale

3228  he looked askance at the offer 
3229  he invested his fortune astutely 
3230  he was acutely insightful 
3231  he pulled the ropes amain 
3232  he was blissfully unaware of the danger 
3233  he fell asleep 
3234  he ran bang into the pole 
3235  he spoke to her banteringly 
3236  he chased her barefoot across the meadow 
3237  he spoke bluntly 
3238  he stated his opinion flat-out 
3239  he was criticized roundly 
3240  he swings breezily into the title song 
3241  he behaved rather bumptiously and offended the hostess 
3242  `I don't know yet,' he answered cagily 
3243  he answered her cantankerously 
3244  he was captiously pedantic 
3245  he addressed her caustically 
3246  he treated his staff cavalierly 
3247  a theological student with whom I argued interminably 
3248  `when I was a girl,' she said chattily, `I used to ride a bicycle' 
3249  I bought this car very cheaply 
3250  he gallantly offered to take her home 
3251  he talked incoherently when he drank too much 
3252  he announced the death of his father collectedly 
3253  he complacently lived out his life as a village school teacher 
3254  he always acts so conceitedly! 
3255  he can no longer think conceptually 
3256  `Are you all right,' he asked concernedly 
3257  he wrote compactly but clearly 
3258  he looked cursorily through the magazine 
3259  he graduated cum laude 
3260  he graduated magna cum laude 
3261  he graduated summa cum laude 
3262  he sat on the floor cross-legged and meditated 
3263  he treats his secretary condescendingly 
3264  he accepted the offer conditionally 
3265  he accepted the offer unconditionally 
3266  crucially, he must meet us at the airport 
3267  he traveled crosstown 
3268  he craftily arranged to be there when the decision was announced 
3269  he had good reason to be grateful for the opportunities which they had made available to him and which consequently led to the good position he now held 
3270  he talked plausibly before the committee 
3271  he will probably win the election 
3272  we will meet again,  he said cryptically
3273  he told me curtly to get on with it 
3274  he talked short with everyone 
3275  he said shortly that he didn't like it 
3276  he wondered dazedly whether the term after next at his new school wouldn't matter so much 
3277  `I don't know,' he said indecisively 
3278  he is potentially dangerous 
3279  he chalked up two goals which deservedly gave Bolton their second victory of the season 
3280  `Let's all have a drink together,' he said congenially 
3281  he looked at his friend's new car jealously 
3282  he behaved ignobly 
3283  daringly, he set out on a camping trip in East Africa 
3284  daringly he took the first step 
3285  he was dashingly handsome 
3286  he pretended to be pleased and applauded decorously 
3287  I willingly accept 
3288  he had sinned against her unwillingly 
3289  he said so in one of his more offensively intellectually arrogant sentences 
3290  he smelled offensively unwashed 
3291  `Come in,' he said distractedly 
3292  he listened deferentially 
3293  he always acts so deferentially around his supervisor 
3294  he was talking deliriously 
3295  `Oh, well,' he shrugged diffidently, `I like the work.' 
3296  he acted despicably 
3297  he is destructively aggressive 
3298  I don't know anyone who could have behaved so abominably 
3299  he got the promotion by behaving deviously 
3300  dextrously he untied the knots 
3301  seeing himself trapped, he cried out direfully 
3302  he drank some sherry, his eyes disconcertingly keen as he watched her 
3303  he was still rumbling discontentedly when Pike returned bearing a folder of foolscap sheets 
3304  in he can't get it honestly, he is willing to steal it 
3305  he acted dishonestly when he gave the contract to his best friend 
3306  honestly, I don't believe it 
3307  candidly, I think she doesn't have a conscience 
3308  frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn 
3309  he behaved hypocritically by praying piously when people were watching 
3310  he was dishonorably discharged 
3311  he was honorably discharged after many years of service 
3312  disingenuously, he asked leading questions abut his opponent's work 
3313  he decided the case disinterestedly 
3314  as he looks at the mess he has left behind he must wonder how the Brits so often managed to succeed in the kind of situation where he has so dismally failed 
3315  he went ahead disobediently and did what his supervisor had warned him not to do 
3316  although he was looking at the other girl, he did so dispassionately 
3317  he made displeasingly cutting remarks about his friends 
3318  might I respectfully suggest to the Town Council that they should adopt a policy of masterly inactivity? 
3319  he treats his parents rather disrespectfully 
3320  he is a dogmatically opinionated critic of Modern Art 
3321  his mother looked at him dolefully when he told her he had joined the Army 
3322  he was bent double with pain 
3323  running downhill, he gained a lot of speed 
3324  I nodded dumbly and he slit the envelope 
3325  he had so rapaciously desired and so obtusely expected to find her alone 
3326  he dutifully visited his mother every Sunday 
3327  he reacted ecstatically to my plan to travel to Africa 
3328  he sawed the board edgeways 
3329  I could not get a word in edgewise 
3330  Bismarck was constantly criticised by the more liberal newspapers, and he retaliated by passing an emergency decree that effectually muzzled the press 
3331  he dealt with the problem rather ineffectively 
3332  he greeted her demonstratively 
3333  he behaved egotistically 
3334  he acted unselfishly when he helped her get the promotion 
3335  he expressed his ideas eloquently 
3336  two subjects on which he was eminently qualified to make an original contribution 
3337  `Go on,' he said encouragingly to his student 
3338  he is an equably cheerful fellow 
3339  he talked eruditely about Indian mythology 
3340  he behaved ethically 
3341  he behaved unethically 
3342  her husband seemed to know many of the people who were named, but he replied evasively when asked who they were 
3343  he was excusably late 
3344  he was inexcusably cruel to his wife 
3345  he spoke extemporaneously 
3346  he behaved treacherously 
3347  Sid, as he was familiarly known by his friends, was one of the most respected and devoted members of the socialist minority group 
3348  he followed the teachings of his guru fanatically 
3349  he writes extremely musical music, of which the sound is fastidiously calculated and yet agreeably spontaneous and imaginative 
3350  he treats his former wife civilly 
3351  he treats his former wife uncivilly 
3352  he solved all the problems faultlessly 
3353  he chose his words rather infelicitously 
3354  he said so literally 
3355  I heard this story firsthand 
3356  he slept fitfully 
3357  he stared at me fixedly 
3358  he is flagrantly disregarding the law 
3359  he dresses rather flamboyantly 
3360  `Come whenever you are free,' he said flexibly 
3361  he answered the reporters' questions flippantly 
3362  he tumbled flop into the mud 
3363  he cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his boss 
3364  unforgivingly, he insisted that she pay her debt to the last penny 
3365  `Come in if you have to,' he said frostily 
3366  he moves about friskily despite his age 
3367  he was seen by a shepherd, gamely negotiating a particularly tricky section of the mountain road to San Doloroso 
3368  he charted his family tree genealogically 
3369  gingerly I raised the edge of the blanket 
3370  I would fain do it 
3371  he spoke gloatingly about people he had cheated out of their money 
3372  where others had failed he had gloriously succeeded 
3373  he stared gloweringly at this morning's headlines 
3374  he insulted us gratuitously 
3375  he grudgingly agreed to have a drink in a hotel close by 
3376  he ungrudgingly agreed to pay for everybody's dinner when the guests found themselves without cash 
3377  he was gruesomely wounded 
3378  `No,' he replied gruffly 
3379  `That's enough!,' he cut in harshly 
3380  he was pushed roughly aside 
3381  he remembered her only hazily 
3382  he fell headlong in love with his cousin 
3383  `To say I am behind the strike is so much nonsense,' declared Mr Harvey heatedly 
3384  he pointed heavenward 
3385  he become reconciled to not dying heroically in her arms 
3386  he climbed high on the ladder 
3387  he lives high up the river 
3388  he lives high 
3389  he behaved high-handedly toward his employees 
3390  he talks high-mindedly, but we don't know whether he acts according to his principles 
3391  he had replied insolently to his superiors 
3392  `Excuse me,' he said hoarsely 
3393  daily, hourly, I grew stronger 
3394  `Don't bother to call me back,' he said huffily 
3395  he reacted rather humorlessly to these rumors 
3396  he pounced on the food hungrily 
3397  he is fitted with an identically similar one 
3398  he expressed himself idiomatically 
3399  this is what I always imagined myself doing in the south of France, sitting idly, drinking coffee, watching the people 
3400  He acted illegitimately when he increased the rent fourfold 
3401  he acted logically under the circumstances 
3402  he smiled at them both impartially 
3403  he acted morally under the circumstances 
3404  he acted immorally when his own interests were at stake 
3405  he submitted impassively to his arrest 
3406  he repeated his position unrepentantly 
3407  he changed noticeably over the years 
3408  imperiously he cut her short 
3409  when I told him about Russ I found it difficult to speak impersonally 
3410  he treated his patients impersonally 
3411  he took her comments personally 
3412  speaking personally, I would not want to go 
3413  he often acts impulsively and later regrets it 
3414  he implicitly assumes that you know the answer 
3415  I implicitly trust him 
3416  he expressed himself imprecisely 
3417  `Precisely, my lord,' he said 
3418  he lived improvidently for the moment 
3419  providently, he had saved up some money for emergencies 
3420  I had allotted my own bedroom for necking, prudently removing both the bed and the key, and taken both myself and my typewriter into my son's bedroom. 
3421  imprudently, he downed tools and ran home to make his wife happy 
3422  he was adequately prepared 
3423  he was incisively critical 
3424  in Holland he lived incognito as a carpenter in the shipyards of the East India company 
3425  he had entered the room inconspicuously 
3426  he is incurably ill 
3427  I sent for the sergeant of the platoon both men were in and asked him to try to find out discreetly what lay behind this 
3428  he lives indolently with his relatives 
3429  it was immediately and indubitably apparent that I had interrupted a scene of lovers 
3430  I was indulgently advised to give the kids what they wanted unless I wished my son to be socially ostracised 
3431  `I can't tell you when the manager will arrive,' he said rather uninformatively 
3432  a Hampshire farmer had fowls of different breeds, including Dorkings, and he discriminated ingeniously between the `dark ones' and the `white ones' 
3433  he has an inimitably verbose style 
3434  he claimed to have purchased the contraband innocently 
3435  he arrived inopportunely just as we sat down for dinner 
3436  he arrived rather opportunely just when we needed a new butler 
3437  he clawed insatiably at the traditional precepts 
3438  he acts very securely in front of the camera 
3439  he spoke from the heart 
3440  he behaves insultingly toward his parents 
3441  he reacts rather tolerantly toward his son's juvenile behavior 
3442  he was visibly upset 
3443  `Get out,' he shouted irately 
3444  ironically, he ended up losing money under his own plan 
3445  he guarded his privacy jealously 
3446  I asked him jokingly whether he thought he could drive the Calcutta-Peshawar express 
3447  he is being journalistically crucified in his own country 
3448  he greeted his friend jovially 
3449  he was keenly aware of his own shortcomings 
3450  he was hanging around the house lackadaisically 
3451  he was sprawling languorously on the sofa 
3452  he felt incensed that Tarrant should have been treated so leniently given his crime 
3453  I watched the blue smoke drift lazily away on the still air 
3454  he looked right and left 
3455  he looked right and left 
3456  he hung around the house lethargically 
3457  he had seen how in their dances the white men and women held one another obscenely 
3458  lifelessly he performed the song 
3459  he spent the rest of the act gazing longingly over my right shoulder at the illuminated word `Exit' 
3460  he was lukewarmly received by his relatives 
3461  he light-heartedly overlooks some of the basic facts of life 
3462  can I stay bit longer? 
3463  `When I was young,' she continued loquaciously, `I used to do all sorts of naughty things' 
3464  I bought some more of these deliciously sweet peaches 
3465  he looked at the young woman lustfully 
3466  magnanimously, he forgave all those who had harmed him 
3467  he was maniacally obsessed with jealousy 
3468  masochistically he insisted on an even greater workload 
3469  round and round, while meditatively, as a cow chewing the cud, he let his eyes rest on the flat water ahead of him 
3470  I told him, quite untruthfully, that I had just returned from leave 
3471  I told him truthfully that I had just returned from my vacation 
3472  he answered the question as truthfully as he could 
3473  he was mercilessly trounced by his opponent in the House 
3474  he served his country meritoriously 
3475  all day long, he mindlessly filled out forms 
3476  he was called on to visit ministerially on the dying man 
3477  I bit my lip miserably and nodded 
3478  he was morbidly fascinated by dead bodies 
3479  he fell morosely on the bed 
3480  he saw the black-haired man waiting motionlessly behind the opposite side of the platform 
3481  `She died last night,' he said sadly 
3482  `It's funny about that bar,' he said musingly 
3483  he believed, naively, that she would leave him her money 
3484  `Don't expect me to help you,' he added nastily 
3485  that was the time he came nearest to death 
3486  he won nip and tuck 
3487  he did his work negligently 
3488  without my reading glasses I can hardly see things close up 
3489  even firing at close range he missed 
3490  I stared at him numbly 
3491  obstreperously, he demanded to get service 
3492  he acted very obstructively when we tried to carry out our project 
3493  he referred opaquely to her recent past 
3494  `We have a good chance of winning,' he exclaimed optimistically 
3495  he evaluated his chances for survival rather pessimistically 
3496  he was outspokenly critical of the Government's new social policy 
3497  he added parenthetically that he would not attend the wedding ceremony 
3498  he behaves very paternally toward his young bride 
3499  patriotically, he buys only U.S.-made products 
3500  unpatriotically he contrived a way of avoiding military service 
3501  I am not using the word pejoratively 
3502  pensively he stared at the painting 
3503  he was playing perfidiously one side against the other 
3504  he looked at his professor perplexedly 
3505  he was asking questions, unavoidable questions, persistently... 
3506  he struggled pertinaciously for the new resolution 
3507  he accepted the decision phlegmatically 
3508  piggishly, he took two pieces of cake 
3509  I put the questions, and she answered them placidly 
3510  I asked him point-blank whether he wanted the job 
3511  he was honored posthumously 
3512  he was recognizably slimmer now 
3513  he had unrecognizably aged 
3514  I must regretfully decline your kind invitation 
3515  he came running pit-a-pat down the hall 
3516  he spent his life in pointlessly tiresome drudgery 
3517  he was Brentford's defensive star in pluckily holding out the determined Reading raids for long periods 
3518  he moves ponderously 
3519  he was sleeping, one arm flung possessively across his wife 
3520  I will send it post-paid 
3521  predictably, he did not like the news 
3522  I spoke prematurely 
3523  he presumptuously overstepped the doctor's orders 
3524  he kept wondering profanely why everything bad happened to him 
3525  he dealt proficiently with the problem 
3526  I applied my attention prosaically to my routine 
3527  `Try it,' he said provocatively 
3528  she acts prudishly, but I wonder whether she is really all that chaste 
3529  he launched into a long history of the birth of communism, giving credit punctiliously to the work of Marx and Engels 
3530  he wrote pungently about his contemporaries 
3531  he caught the motorcycles in the full glare of his headlights, braked and slipped purposefully out of the car 
3532  `Do I have to remove the liver,' the medical student asked queasily 
3533  sent to jail for two years, he has quixotically refused to clear himself by betraying his colleagues 
3534  I took the cigarette he offered, drawing at it raggedly 
3535  he watched her reflectively 
3536  resignedly, I telegraphed back that it was all right with me if he insisted 
3537  he then so resoundingly denounced his former friend 
3538  he did respectably well for his age 
3539  I can sell it to you wholesale 
3540  retrospectively, he seems like a great artist 
3541  he plotted vindictively against his former superiors 
3542  he gazed reverently at the handiwork 
3543  `What can be done?' he asked rhetorically 
3544  he acted unrighteously 
3545  he lost the game by playing too riskily 
3546  he was robustly built 
3547  he winked at her roguishly 
3548  he roguishly intended to keep the money 
3549  he hit the ball round-arm 
3550  `Ah, now we're getting at the truth,' he interposed sarcastically 
3551  he looked at her sceptically 
3552  he came off second-best 
3553  the teacher raised a hand to him, slightly and secretively, because he was her favorite 
3554  he sniffed the perfume voluptuously 
3555  I had the feeling that he was waiting, too--serenely patient 
3556  sheepishly he handed her back the money 
3557  he fell sheer into the water 
3558  he looked at his new customer shiftily 
3559  he treated her shoddily 
3560  I was caught short 
3561  She took him up short before he could continue 
3562  he fell short of our expectations 
3563  he made his fortune by selling short just before the crash 
3564  I built this house single-handedly 
3565  he explained sketchily 
3566  he extolled her virtues sky-high 
3567  he expresses himself slangily 
3568  he was lying in bed sleeplessly 
3569  `And now,' he said smoothly, `we will continue the conversation' 
3570  he stood slouchingly at the garden gate 
3571  unsmilingly, he greeted his in-laws 
3572  I always felt sneakingly that I wanted to be a concert pianist 
3573  `I don't believe in these customs,' he said sneeringly 
3574  I missed him sorely 
3575  he stood up soundlessly and speechlessly and glided across the hallway and through a door 
3576  he complained sourly that the new rules only benefitted the managers 
3577  I began to write intermittently and spasmodically 
3578  he stood up soundlessly and speechlessly and glided across the hallway and through a door 
3579  he was sitting unsuspectingly beyond that wall only a few yards from the burglar 
3580  he was trimly attired 
3581  `I would rather not touch,' he said squeamishly 
3582  `I cannot show my face at her house,' he declared theatrically 
3583  standoffishly, he declined the invitation to the office party 
3584  he staunchly defended his principles 
3585  he was breathing stertorously 
3586  he felt the blood move stickily from his split scalp and trickle down his forehead 
3587  he talked stirringly about his days during the war 
3588  he sat still as a statue 
3589  he couldn't hold still any longer 
3590  he stayed in London or thereabouts for several weeks 
3591  I have learned that whatever state I am, therewith to be content - Phil.4:11
3592  thy slanders I forgive
3593  he was stockily built 
3594  he stoically accepted all suffering 
3595  `Come in please,' he said stuffily 
3596  he is suavely charming and all the ladies love him 
3597  `What else could I do?' said Graham sulkily 
3598  superfluously, he added his silly comments to the discussion 
3599  superstitiously he refused to travel on Friday the 13th 
3600  he called the tune to me and I supinely took it up 
3601  he was watching her surreptitiously as she waited in the hotel lobby 
3602  he sweepingly condemned the entire population of the country for the war crimes 
3603  he stepped tactfully in to prevent trouble 
3604  at the moment of the murder, he is standing in front of television cameras and talking tactlessly 
3605  he used the privileges of his office temperately 
3606  `Are you sure?' he asked her tetchily 
3607  he dealt with the problem of evil theologically, not philosophically 
3608  after a few drinks he was beginning to speak thickly 
3609  a used towel that he had used and had left thriftily on the ledge below the mirror rather than consign to the linen basket 
3610  he lives thriftlessly from day to day 
3611  he touchily refused all offers to help 
3612  he defended his client's civil rights trenchantly 
3613  he paused uncertainly 
3614  he was unwantedly friendly 
3615  uncouthly, he told stories that made everybody at the table wince 
3616  I can unreservedly recommend this restaurant! 
3617  he silenced the whisperings which connected her, untruly and unfairly, with his separation from his wife 
3618  he acted honorably 
3619  he acted dishonorably 
3620  he kept deferring uxoriously to Mary 
3621  he fought valiantly until the end 
3622  he vehemently denied the accusations against him 
3623  I verily think so 
3624  he describes his adventures vivaciously 
3625  he sneaks voyeuristically around the swimming pool 
3626  he talked wheezily 
3627  he adopted wholeheartedly some of the policies that he had previously criticized 
3628  he traveled widely 
3629  he wishfully indulged in dreams of fame 
3630  his sister would have looked beautiful in that dress, he thought wistfully, just like an angel 
3631  he would wittily chime into our conversation 
3632  he paused worriedly before calling the bank 
3633  he looked at her, not wrathfully now, but quizzically 
3634  `I can't remember who I am,' I said, wretchedly 
3635  I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice 
3636  he is still youthfully enthusiastic 
3637  he was convicted circumstantially 
3638  he followed his leader unquestioningly 
3639  he became demandingly dominant over the years 
3640  he talked gently to the injured animal 
3641  he passed immediately behind her 
3642  he was directly responsible 
3643  I prefer to buy second hand 
3644  he remained close on his guard 
3645  he was naturally lazy 
3646  he looked at her calculatingly 
3647  he was fatally ill equipped for the climb 
3648  he went overboard to please his in-laws 
3649  I was here first 
3650  he whistled tunelessly 
3651  he walked heavily up the three flights to his room 
3652  I was not born yesterday! 
3653  he stayed later than you did 
3654  he looked up loweringly 
3655  I know better. 
3656  he felt out of place in the lingerie shop 
3657  he cradled it, baby-wise, in his arms 
3658  he expected the very opposite 
3659  the senator didn't realize that he was speaking on camera 
3660  he prefers to throw sidearm 
3661  I can breathe better when the air is clean 
3662  he huffed and puffed as he made his way up the mountain 
3663  His heart fibrillated and he died 
3664  The dog acts ferocious, but he is really afraid of people 
3665  I bungled it! 
3666  On Sundays, I sleep in 
3667  he always falls asleep during lectures 
3668  I usually turn in at midnight 
3669  I get up at 7 A.M. every day 
3670  I kept myself up all night studying for the exam 
3671  I picked up after a nap 
3672  he got a phone call from his lawyer that tensed him up 
3673  He tensed up when he saw his opponent enter the room 
3674  After a hard day's work, I vegetate in front of the television 
3675  He grimaced when he saw the amount of homework he had to do 
3676  he cleared his throat before he started to speak 
3677  I condition my hair after washing it 
3678  he dressed up in a suit and tie 
3679  I sweated off 3 pounds in the sauna 
3680  What should I wear today? 
3681  I am carrying his child 
3682  I pulled a muscle in my leg when I jumped up 
3683  he swallowed a fishbone and gagged 
3684  I could freeze to death in this office when the air conditioning is turned on 
3685  She poisoned her husband but he did not die 
3686  I turned my ankle and couldn't walk for several days 
3687  I got funny spots all over my body 
3688  The old man rejuvenated when he became a grandfather 
3689  At the end of the march, I pooped out 
3690  We salivated when he described the great meal 
3691  he feels like a million after he got the promotion 
3692  I was called at 5 A.M. this morning 
3693  I broke my foot while playing hockey 
3694  he won't step into his father's footsteps 
3695  The people turned against the President when he stole the election 
3696  Keep him in bed until he sobers up 
3697  After thinking about the potential consequences of his plan, he sobered up 
3698  He became annoyed when he heard the bad news 
3699  After moving back to America, he had to readjust 
3700  My courage shrivelled when I saw the task before me 
3701  he eased off the gas pedal and the car slowed down 
3702  he modified his views on same-gender marriage 
3703  he souped up the old cars 
3704  I adjoin a copy of your my lawyer's letter 
3705  I broke in the new intern 
3706  I've upgraded my computer so I can run better software 
3707  he conditions old cars 
3708  he reinforced the concrete 
3709  I am tied to UNIX 
3710  I draw the line when it comes to lending money to friends! 
3711  With age, he mellowed 
3712  he relapsed 
3713  My skin breaks out when I eat strawberries 
3714  She gets to fretting if I stay away from home too long 
3715  I attacked the problem as soon as I got out of bed 
3716  he persisted to call me every night 
3717  he obstinates himself against all rational arguments 
3718  he wound up being unemployed and living at home again 
3719  She ended their friendship when she found out that he had once been convicted of a crime 
3720  The attack on Poland terminated the relatively peaceful period after WW I 
3721  I singed my eyebrows 
3722  he phased the intake with the output of the machine 
3723  he unnecessarily complexified every problem 
3724  I need to structure my days 
3725  After his accident, he had to restructure his life 
3726  I was fixing to leave town after I paid the hotel bill 
3727  After a year in Iowa, he has totally Americanized 
3728  He stiffened when he saw his boss enter the room 
3729  I hope the list key is going to surface again 
3730  He slackened his pace as he got tired 
3731  I need some pepper to complement the sweet touch in the soup 
3732  The President stonewalled when he realized the plot was being uncovered by a journalist 
3733  I was caught in traffic and missed the meeting 
3734  he left the monastery purified 
3735  During his stay at the ashram he was spiritualized 
3736  I finally got through this homework assignment 
3737  I must see the job through 
3738  he capped off the meeting with a radical proposal 
3739  Did he go through with the treatment? 
3740  he clocked the runners 
3741  The dentist sequesters the tooth he is working on 
3742  My dog was quarantined before he could live in England 
3743  The earth that he fructified 
3744  he inked his finger 
3745  I freckle easily 
3746  Flag this file so that I can recognize it immediately 
3747  he played down his royal ancestry 
3748  I set off these words by brackets 
3749  I need to charge my car battery 
3750  I got nothing but trouble for my good intentions 
3751  he adopted an air of superiority 
3752  I came to realize the true meaning of life 
3753  When he spent a summer at camp, the boy grew noticeably and no longer showed some of his old adolescent behavior 
3754  I have outgrown these clothes 
3755  I shall not dignify this insensitive remark with an answer 
3756  I acquired a strong aversion to television 
3757  His voice began to change when he was 12 years old 
3758  he washed the dirt from his coat 
3759  he managed to wash out the stains 
3760  he bought a device to digitize the data 
3761  my eyebrows singed when I bent over the flames 
3762  The airline upgraded me when I arrived late and Coach Class was full 
3763  I upgraded to First Class when Coach Class was overbooked 
3764  He flipped when he heard that he was being laid off 
3765  I understand what she means 
3766  I sensed the real meaning of his letter 
3767  I sense his hostility 
3768  When he lectures, I cannot follow 
3769  I just don't get him 
3770  I cannot digest all this information 
3771  Now I see! 
3772  I just can't see your point 
3773  I don't understand the idea 
3774  he was attorned by the tenants 
3775  I understand you have no previous experience? 
3776  I know him under a different name 
3777  I know that the President lied to the people 
3778  I want to know who is winning the game! 
3779  I know it's time 
3780  I keep track of the stock market developments 
3781  I know that I left the key on the table 
3782  I know Latin 
3783  I know the feeling! 
3784  I have lived a kind of hell when I was a drug addict 
3785  I lived through two divorces 
3786  I learned Sanskrit 
3787  After the accident, he could not walk for months and had to relearn how to walk down stairs 
3788  I learned that she has two grown-up children 
3789  I see that you have been promoted 
3790  Am I supposed to swallow that story? 
3791  he absorbed the knowledge or beliefs of his tribe 
3792  I had to bone up on my Latin verbs before the final exam 
3793  he dinned the lessons into his students 
3794  I hold to these ideas 
3795  I have an exam next week
3796  I can't remember saying any such thing 
3797  I can't think what her last name was 
3798  Do you remember that he once loved you? 
3799  I know this voice! 
3800  I cannot retain so much information 
3801  I tried to bury these unpleasant memories 
3802  he remembered how he used to pick flowers 
3803  I forgot my umbrella in the restaurant 
3804  I left my keys inside the car and locked the doors 
3805  How could I miss that typo? 
3806  he neglects his children 
3807  I misremembered the date 
3808  I mistook her for the secretary 
3809  I read you loud and clear! 
3810  I read this address as a satire 
3811  How should I take this message? 
3812  I misread Hamlet all my life! 
3813  I cannot make out what this politician is saying 
3814  I can't read his strange behavior 
3815  I should proofread my manuscripts 
3816  I mulled over the events of the afternoon 
3817  I rarely premeditate, which is a mistake 
3818  I imagine she earned a lot of money with her new novel 
3819  I thought to find her in a bad state 
3820  he didn't think to find her in the kitchen 
3821  I guess she is angry at me for standing her up 
3822  I assume his train was late 
3823  he thinks and theorizes all day 
3824  The results of the elections were still being processed when he gave his acceptance speech 
3825  I miscalculated the number of guests at the wedding 
3826  I was analyzed in Vienna by a famous psychiatrist 
3827  He googled the woman he had met at the party 
3828  I treated his advances as a joke 
3829  He bristled at her suggestion that he should teach her how to use the program 
3830  I was stereotyped as a lazy Southern European 
3831  I was carded when I tried to buy a beer! 
3832  I cannot bear his constant criticism 
3833  he learned to tolerate the heat 
3834  I shall have to accept these unpleasant working conditions 
3835  I swallowed the insult 
3836  I won't stand for this kind of behavior! 
3837  I won't take this insult lying down 
3838  I cannot judge some works of modern art 
3839  he underestimated the work that went into the renovation 
3840  I estimate this chicken to weigh three pounds 
3841  I gave him a very good chance at success 
3842  I plumped for the losing candidates 
3843  I elected to have my funds deposited automatically 
3844  I always choose the fish over the meat courses in this restaurant 
3845  I will have the family jewels appraised by a professional 
3846  I believed his report 
3847  I can't buy this story 
3848  I include you in the list of culprits 
3849  I can count my colleagues in the opposition 
3850  John was ruled out as a possible suspect because he had a strong alibi 
3851  I reject the idea of starting a war 
3852  I cannot accept the dogma of this church 
3853  I doubt that she will accept his proposal of marriage 
3854  I doubt these reports 
3855  I suspect her true motives 
3856  I swear by my grandmother's recipes 
3857  I think he is very smart 
3858  I believe her to be very smart 
3859  I think that he is her boyfriend 
3860  I made the students feel different about themselves 
3861  I consider her to be shallow 
3862  I don't see the situation quite as negatively as you do 
3863  I would not call her beautiful 
3864  I hold him personally responsible 
3865  I respect his judgement 
3866  I reviewed the material before the test 
3867  I make the height about 100 feet 
3868  he resolved never to drink again 
3869  I contemplated leaving school and taking a full-time job 
3870  I hope to have finished this work by tomorrow evening 
3871  I mean no harm 
3872  I only meant to help you 
3873  I aim to arrive at noon 
3874  I want you here at noon! 
3875  he masterminded the robbery 
3876  I had misestimated his determination 
3877  I cannot connect these two pieces of evidence in my mind 
3878  I cannot relate these events at all 
3879  I cannot interrelate these two events 
3880  I cannot correlate these two pieces of information 
3881  I feel that he doesn't like me 
3882  I find him to be obnoxious 
3883  I found the movie rather entertaining 
3884  I cannot narrow down the rules for this game 
3885  I presuppose that you have done your work 
3886  he flipped when he heard that he was accepted into Princeton University 
3887  The boss exploded when he heard of the resignation of the secretary 
3888  he is waiting to be drafted 
3889  I look to hear from you soon 
3890  I believe that he will come back from the war 
3891  She found that he had lied to her 
3892  The story is false, so far as I can discover 
3893  I allow for this possibility 
3894  I have not budgeted for these expensive meals 
3895  I will earmark this money for your research 
3896  Father exploded a bombshell when he forbade us to go to the prom 
3897  he caught her staring out the window 
3898  I'm thinking of good food when I talk about France 
3899  Yes, I meant you when I complained about people who gossip! 
3900  I draw a line here 
3901  I cannot keep track of all my employees 
3902  I put these memories with those of bygone times 
3903  I swallowed my anger and kept quiet 
3904  He never contacted his children after he emigrated to Australia 
3905  I try to reach out to my daughter but she doesn't want to have anything to do with me 
3906  I couldn't get across the message 
3907  I said to him to go home 
3908  Now listen, friends,  he began
3909  I was stung with a huge tax bill 
3910  I give you two minutes to respond 
3911  I directed them towards the town hall 
3912  I requested that she type the entire manuscript 
3913  The boss demanded that he be fired immediately 
3914  I expect my students to arrive in time for their lessons 
3915  He claimed that he killed the burglar 
3916  I beg you to stop! 
3917  I pleaded with him to stop 
3918  he professes to be a Communist 
3919  If he plea-bargains, he will be sent to a medium-security prison for 8 years 
3920  I urged him to finish his studies 
3921  I let it be known that I was not interested 
3922  he clamored for justice and tolerance 
3923  I assured him that traveling to Cambodia was safe

3927  he was solicited by a prostitute 
3928  I asked about their special today 
3929  I tried to call you all night 
3930  If the train is late, I will cell phone you 
3931  Please hang on while I get your folder 
3932  I am busy right now--can you call back in an hour? 
3933  he buzzed the servant 
3934  I scheduled an exam for this afternoon 
3935  I forbid you to call me late at night 
3936  he declined to join the group on a hike 
3937  I cannot accept your invitation 
3938  I go for this resolution 
3939  I won't let the police search her basement 
3940  I cannot allow you to see your exam 
3941  I beg to differ!

3949  I have to sound out the new professor 
3950  he evaded the questions skillfully 
3951  Fortunately, I missed the hurricane 
3952  I couldn't get out from under these responsibilities 
3953  I shy away from this task 
3954  I wrestled with this decision for years 
3955  He makes no bones about the fact that he is gay 
3956  I must insist! 
3957  I attest this signature 
3958  He declared that he was innocent 
3959  After he was shown to have performed a miracle, the priest was canonized 
3960  I taught them French 
3961  I informed him of his rights 
3962  I warned you that I would ask some difficult questions

3984  I offered to leave the committee if they did not accept my proposal 
3985  The lawyer counselled me when I was accused of tax fraud

4003  I absolve you from this responsibility 
4004  I wash my hands of this

4006  I forgave him his infidelity 
4007  The lawyer got him off, even though there was no doubt in everybody's mind that he killed his wife 
4008  Our sponsor kept our art studio going for as long as he could 
4009  He scolded about anything that he thought was wrong 
4010  he declaimed against the wasteful ways of modern society 
4011  What was he hollering about? 
4012  I deplore this hostile action

4016  I yelled to her from the window but she couldn't hear me 
4017  `Get out of here,' he roared 
4018  I am guessing that the price of real estate will rise again 
4019  I cannot pretend to say that you are wrong 
4020  Let us say that he did not tell the truth 
4021  I bet she will be there! 
4022  I want to see whether she speaks French 
4023  find out if he speaks Russian 
4024  I suspect he is a fugitive 
4025  I surmised that the butler did it 
4026  Just when I entered, the clock struck 
4027  I showed the customer the glove section 
4028  he indicated his opponents 
4029  I wonder whether this was the right thing to do 
4030  I need to mature my thoughts 
4031  I insinuated that I did not like his wife 
4032  Did his face say anything about how he felt? 
4033  I don't know how to sign, so I could not communicate with my deaf cousin 
4034  he broke the news to her 
4035  He sprang these news on me just as I was leaving 
4036  I gather you have not done your homework 
4037  he was telling on all his former colleague 
4038  You never understand what I mean! 
4039  I have to translate when my in-laws from Austria visit the U.S.

4064  He alleged that he was the victim of a crime

4194  I can see a risk in this strategy 
4195  I cannot envision him as President
